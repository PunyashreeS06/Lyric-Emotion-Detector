And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)

Listening to my heart instead of my head

You found another one, but

I am the better one

You left me falling and landing inside my grave

I know that you want me dead (cough)

I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay

I know it's all in my head



I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing

You were my everything

Thoughts of a wedding ring

Now I'm just better off dead (coughs)

I'll do it over again

I didn't want it to end

I watch it blow in the wind

I should've listened to my friends

Did this shit in the past

But I want it to last

You were with your friends, partyin'
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead so
You show up at my home all alone

With a shovel and a rose

Do you think I'm a joke? 'Cause



People like you always want back

What they can't have

But I'm past that

And you know that

So you should turn back

To your rat pack

Tell 'em I'm trash



Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy

And drive you mad

That I'm such a stalker, a watcher

A psychopath

Then tell them you hate me and dated

Me just for laughs

So why do you call me and tell me

You want me back? You maniac



You maniac

You maniac

You just went too far, wrecked your car

Call me crying in the dark

Now you're breaking my heart

So I show up at your place right away

Wipe the tears off of your face

While you beg me to stay, well

Not somethin' to conquer

I hope she like Nicki, I'll make her a monster

Not havin' menages

I'm just being silly

I answered the door, like Will Smith and Martin

Nigga do we have a problem?

Matter of fact Marlin, this ain't Meet the Fockers

I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges

No daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters

Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates

Just play piano and stick to karate

I pray your body's draped more like mine and not like your mommy's

Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts

And I am a nigga, I know what they want

I pray that you don't get it all at once

Curves under your dress

I know it's pervs all on the net

All in the comments, you wanna vomit

That's your baby, you love her to death

Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends

You break a glass and say it again

She can't comprehend the danger she's in

If you whip her ass, she move in with him

Then he whip her ass, you go through it again

But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?

Let's pray we can put this behind us

I swear that these times is the wildest

She got the scars, they serve as reminders

Blood still on her pajamas, but yesterday is dead, yeah

Moment of silence

Next she'll be off to college

And then at the altar

'Cause she know that niggas is savage

Niggas is monsters

Niggas is pimps, niggas is players

'Til niggas have daughters

Niggas is pimps, niggas is players

'Til niggas have daughters



Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried

It was all part of the story, even the scary nights

Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw

Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)

They gotta repeat the colors, the light is wearin' off

Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off

Colors drippin' off

The demons that he's facing alone (Sometimes it hurts baby)

Keep it down on the low key

You should know how it feels (hey!)

I seen shorty, she was checkin' up on me

From the game she was spittin' in my ear

You would think that she know me

I decided to chill (okay!)

Conversation got heavy

She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow (watch out!)

Ohh! (Watch out)

She's all up in my head now

Got me thinkin' that it might be a good idea to take her with me

Cause she's ready to leave, ready to leave now (let's go!)

And I got to keep it real now

Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty

But that's just ain't me (hey!)

Cause I don't know, if I take that chance

Just where's it gonna lead

But what I do know is the way she dance

And forget about game, I'mma spit the truth (what)

I won't stop till I get 'em in their birthday suit (yeah!)

So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes

Then bend over to the front and touch your toes

I left the Jag and I took the Rolls

If they ain't cuttin', then I put em on foot patrol (let's go!)

How you like me now

When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand

Let's drink, you the one to please (yeah!)

Just send me naked pictures

Stuck in my feelings and vows

She stopped returning my calls

Flaws turn into walls and barriacades

And I'm too fucked on and over both ways

And now every long day is a bad one

I can't make you call and make you stay

Or take you off the pedestal



So I get lost in modern music watchin' movies

Talkin' to the walls in my room

Walkin' through the halls in my head

Just tryna make sure it all makes sense

I ain't made of money

Maybe someday you could take it from me

You been caught up in the mix, nigga, yeah

Got it lit in this bitch like a Bic, nigga, yeah

Keep a Draco, bitch, it fuckin' kick, nigga, yeah

Boom-boom-boom-boom

Ain't talkin 'bout shit, nigga, yeah



Don't talk to strangers

Since a youngin' I've been totin' bangers

I might take that lil' bitch to Topanga

I said, ""Stop, little bitch, you in danger""

Yeah-eah, you in danger

I might take your lil' ass to Topanga

Just don't move like no motherfuckin' stranger

Know I tote bangers, boom-boom-boom-boom

Stop, you in danger



I can take you to Topanga

Open my hands like Jesus and save ya

Know I'm known to tote bangers

Said, ""Boo-boo-boom, you in danger""

Stop that now, you in danger

Stop right now, you in danger

Stop that now, you in danger

Stop right now, you in danger, yeah","trap, emo rap, chipmunk soul, chill, soul, rap, gospel, producer, pop rap, 10s, fallon, Rap Hip-Hop, banger, cloud rap, Trap Soul, trippie redd, MySpotigramBot, -1001854528204",calm
60SdxE8apGAxMiRrpbmLY0,Eminem,Lucky You (feat. Joyner Lucas),,,,,,,,,,,"Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules

I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose

Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food

Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you

Fuck you too, woah!



Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move

Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice

Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice



Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall

Turn my back on you all and you're finished

Back to these bullets, it's back to the job

Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'

Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'

These packs and I'm actually pumpin'

Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'

You might've went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'

I'm actually buzzin' this time

Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine

I do not fuck with you guys

If I don't care you just know that you gonna suffer this time

I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers

Some chains and some blades in and a couple of knives

Choppers and jammies, a partridge in a pear tree

My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies

Why don't you holla like a sumo (sumo)

They say I talk like a chulo (chulo)

I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno

Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo

You play your cards, I reverse on you all

And I might just drop four like an Uno

Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo

They've invented a level off in the ghetto to ghetto

Lookin' for something that prolly can never find out

Shake irrelevant and tell 'em to beef right now

What you would nigga? You really want me tied down

I've been alone and I never needed nobody

Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down

Keep all of the money, I never wanted the lifestyle

I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now

I said ain't no love for the other side

Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)

When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope

You in the wrong cab down the wrong path

Nigga wrong way, the wrong road

Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast

I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower



I have said a lotta things in my day, I admit it

This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it

I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em

Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition

Fuck's the difference?

I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules

Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose

I been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full

I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me

Fuck you think? (woo!)



I got a couple of mansions

Still I don't have any manners

You got a couple of ghost writers

But to these kids it don't actually matter

They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""

I said, ""I don't have any answers.""

'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album

It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers

And actually comin' from humble beginnings

I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning

I wish I could say ""What a wonderful feeling!""

We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling

But nothin' is stealing like anyone has any fuckin' ability

To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me, the inability to pin humility

Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'

Songs about nothin' and mumble!

And fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular

Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up

Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck

About the ones that were here before you to make raps, it's recap

Way back, MC's that recap and tape decks

ADAT's with the G raps and Kane's hat

We need 3 stacks ASAP, and bring Masta Ace back

Because half of these rappers have brain damage

All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap

I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad

But in fact with a old-me at the same cat that would take that

Feedback and aim back, I need that

But I think it's inevitable

They all got button to press or a lever to pull

They give me the snap though (lil' bitch)

And if I paid attention I'd probably makin' it big

But you've been takin' the dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)

On the brink in a minute

Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything

With acetaminophen then reapin' the benefits

I'ma sleep at the wheel again

As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent

Of another beat 'em and kill again

'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again

Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the Manidon

It better be at least 70 to 300 milligram

And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again

Levels to this shit, I got an elevator

You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker

I sound like a broken record every time I break a record

Nobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator

Motherfucker never got a right to be this way

I got spite inside my DNA

But I work 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy

It's the moment y'all been waitin' for

Like California wishin' rain would pour

And that drought y'all have been prayin' for

My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw

Still the same Marshall that outlaw

That they say is a writer might've fell off

But back on that bull like the cowboys



So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move

Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice

Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice","Hip-Hop, rap, joyner lucas, hip hop, 2018, pop, Masterpiece, 2010s, Eminem, Caetano Veloso, Joao Gilberto, antonio carlos jobim, mac miller, tyler the creator, jorge ben jor, chance the rapper, Rejjie Snow, 2010s rap",energetic
